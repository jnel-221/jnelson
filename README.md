## Description
A mobile responsive portfolio created with Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Overview
This portfolio uses Bootstrap CSS Framework to create dynamic, mobile responsive site.  

## For Development
Currently the portfolio page contains placeholder images (photos taken by me on various adventures).  These will be replaced with screenshots of (and links to) projects as I develop them.  The Contact Me form components are not yet functional.  Github, Linked-In, and other profile links will be added as I update my profiles and gain coding experience.

## Resources 
Bootstrap CSS
Google Fonts
Unsplash
