## Description
A mobile responsive portfolio created with Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Overview
The objective of this project was to create a responsive portfolio that presents well in large, medium, and small viewports with minimal media queries.  For this, I focused on creating a simple bootstrap framework for the content on all pages, and customizing some of the styling on a few of the Bootstrap components.  The following components were used and/or customized:
1.  Navbar:  the Navbar brand was customized with unique font and background colors.  Placement of navigation links altered so that the links are alligned to the right.  Pseudo classes used to alter color of text in Navbar brand and background color of navigation links when hovering.
2. External Content: the collapse plugin was used to reveal external content when the navigation toggler is clicked.
3. Footer:  styling added to create a sticky footer, this styling was created referencing an example on getbootstrap.com.  Custom colors and styling added.
4. Portfolio:  The portfolio utilizes sub-rows, sub-columns, and additional CSS styling for uniform display of portfolio images.
5. Contact Me: The contact me page utilizes Bootstrap form components for the name, email, and  message fields as well as submit button.  Pseudo classe used to change color of submit button text upon hovering.

The following design resources were used:
1. Google fonts: Fonts for all text except example text within form fields customized with two Google fonts. 'Montserrat' was used for all headings and submit button.  'Open-Sans' used for paragraphs, links, footer text and form field headings.
2. Unsplash: photocredit for the open-source background image found on unsplash.com goes to N Kamalov.
3. Portfolio Placeholder Photos: the photos used as placeholder images were taken from my photo collection (taken by me when out and about).

## For Development
Currently the portfolio page contains placeholder images (photos taken by me on various adventures).  These will be replaced with screenshots of (and links to) projects as I develop them.  The Contact Me form components are not yet functional.  Github, Linked-In, and other profile links will be added as I update my profiles and gain coding experience.
